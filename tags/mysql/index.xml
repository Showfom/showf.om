      <description>Debian 9 Stretch was released on June 18, 2017. Because it&amp;rsquo;s the latest operating system, the old LEMP (Linux + Nginx + MySQL + PHP) installation tutorials based on Dotdeb have become obsolete. This article will demonstrate how to install the latest version of LEMP on Debian 9.x Stretch using both official and third-party repositories. You will be able to select your preferred version of PHP.
This article is also applicable to Debian 8.</description>

      <description>LEMP is the acronym for Linux + Nginx + MySQL + PHP. It is also known as LNMP (which is unpronounceable, so we&amp;rsquo;ll call it LEMP).
The following tutorial is for Ubuntu versions 16.04.x and 14.04.x. However, we would always recommend to use the latest version to avoid bugs from lower ones.
We recommend you following the instructions as the root user. To switch to the root user, use the command sudo -i.</description>
